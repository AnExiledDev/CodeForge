# Roadmap

> Features live in the priority-graded backlog until pulled into a version.
> Versions are scoped and spec'd when ready to build — not pre-assigned.
> See `BACKLOG.md` for the feature backlog.

## How Versioning Works

1. **Backlog** — All desired features live in `BACKLOG.md`, graded by priority.
2. **Version scoping** — When ready to start a new version, pull features from the backlog.
3. **Spec first** — Each feature in a version gets a spec before implementation begins.
4. **Ship** — Version is done when all its specs are implemented and verified.

Only the **next version** is defined in detail. Everything else is backlog.
