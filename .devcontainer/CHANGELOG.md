# CodeForge Devcontainer Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Documentation
- **DevContainer CLI guide** — dedicated Getting Started page for terminal-only workflows without VS Code
- **v2 Migration Guide** — path changes, automatic migration, manual steps, breaking changes, and troubleshooting
- Documented 4 previously undocumented agents in agents.md: implementer, investigator, tester, documenter
- Added missing git-workflow and prompt-snippets to configuration.md enabledPlugins example
- Added CONFIG_SOURCE_DIR deprecation note in environment variables reference
- Added cc-orc orchestrator command to first-session launch commands table
- Tabbed client-specific instructions on the installation page
- Dedicated port forwarding reference page covering VS Code auto-detect, devcontainer-bridge, and SSH tunneling

### Changed

#### Performance
- Commented out Rust toolchain feature — saves ~1.23 GB image size; uncomment in `devcontainer.json` if needed
- Commented out ccms feature pending replacement tool (requires Rust)
- Updated Bun feature to install latest version (was pinned to outdated 1.3.9)
- Added npm cache cleanup to 6 features: agent-browser, ast-grep, biome, claude-session-dashboard, lsp-servers, tree-sitter (saves ~96 MB runtime disk)

#### System Prompts
- **Main system prompt redesigned** — reorganized from 672 to 462 lines with new section order prioritizing personality, core directives, and response guidelines at the top
- **Added personality section** — defines communication style (casual-professional, direct, terse), humor rules, honesty approach, AuDHD-aware patterns, and good/bad response examples; replaces the empty `<identity>` tag
- **Compressed specification management** — reduced from 98 to 28 lines; full template and enforcement workflow moved to loadable skills
- **Compressed code standards** — removed textbook principle recitations (SOLID, DRY/KISS/YAGNI by name); kept only concrete actionable rules
- **Removed browser automation section** — moved to loadable skill (relevant in <10% of sessions)
- **Removed git worktrees section** — moved to loadable skill; EnterWorktree and `--worktree` flag documented in CLAUDE.md
- **Added context-passing protocol** to orchestration — mandatory instructions for including gathered context, file paths, and constraints when spawning subagents
- **Absorbed `<assumption_surfacing>` into `<core_directives>`** — key rules preserved, wrapper removed
- **Absorbed `<professional_objectivity>` into `<personality>`** — technical accuracy stance woven into personality definition
- **Deduplicated team composition examples** — consolidated into orchestration section only
- **Consolidated "no filler" instructions** — previously stated three different ways across three sections

#### Agent System
- **All 21 agents now have communication protocols** — read-only agents get "Handling Uncertainty" (make best judgment, flag assumptions); write-capable agents get "Question Surfacing Protocol" (BLOCKED + return for ambiguity)
- **Architect agent: anti-fluff enforcement** — explicit banned patterns ("This approach follows best practices...", restating the problem, explaining why the approach is good), good/bad plan line examples
- **Architect agent: team orchestration planning** — can now plan teammate composition, file ownership, task dependencies, and worktree usage when tasks warrant parallel work
- **Architect agent: strengthened output format** — team plan section added, edit ordering section added, file references must be specific
- **Generalist agent rewritten as last-resort** — description changed to "LAST RESORT agent. Only use when NO specialist agent matches", identity paragraph flags when a specialist might have been better
- **Investigator agent: structured output guidance** — added instruction to include actionable next steps, not just observations
- **Added Bash guard hooks** to researcher, debug-logs, and perf-profiler agents — prevents accidental state-changing commands in read-only agents

#### Port Forwarding
- Dynamic port forwarding for all ports in VS Code — previously only port 7847 was statically forwarded; now all ports auto-forward with notification

#### Documentation
- Updated **Port Forwarding reference** — VS Code dependency warning, devcontainer-bridge platform support matrix, CLI guide cross-link
- Slimmed **Installation page** — moved troubleshooting to dedicated reference page, CLI details to new CLI guide
- Full documentation review — accuracy, consistency, and completeness fixes across all 30+ pages
- Trimmed disabled ccms usage section from commands reference
- Clarified codeforge-lsp plugin description (declarative config, not "no configuration")
- Improved magic-docs agent explanation in agent-system plugin docs
- Clarified plugin count as "13 local + 1 official" in reference index
- Updated prerequisites and installation docs to support all DevContainer clients (VS Code, CLI, JetBrains Gateway, DevPod, Codespaces)
- **Ported `.devcontainer/docs/` to docs site** — migrated content from 5 legacy reference docs into the Starlight documentation site:
  - New **Keybindings** page (Customization) — VS Code/Claude Code shortcut conflicts and resolution options
  - New **Troubleshooting** page (Reference) — 12+ problem/solution entries for build, auth, plugins, and performance issues
  - New **Optional Features** page (Customization) — mcp-qdrant vector memory setup guide
  - Merged setup variables (`.env` flags) into the Environment Variables reference
  - Merged `.secrets` file authentication docs into the Configuration page
- Removed `.devcontainer/docs/` directory — all content now lives in the docs site
- **Versioned docs infrastructure** — installed `starlight-versions` plugin; no archived versions yet, first snapshot will be taken when v3 development begins
- **Fixed docs site URL** — updated `site` to `https://codeforge.core-directive.com` and removed `/CodeForge` base path (custom domain serves from root)

### Fixed

#### Bun
- Bun PATH not available in non-interactive shells — Bun is now accessible in all shell contexts

#### Session Context Plugin
- **Commit reminder** no longer blocks Claude from stopping — switched from `decision: "block"` to advisory `systemMessage` wrapped in `<system-reminder>` tags
- **Commit reminder** now uses tiered logic: meaningful changes (3+ files, 2+ source files, or test files) get an advisory suggestion; small changes are silent
- **Commit reminder** only fires when the session actually modified files (via new PostToolUse edit tracker), preventing false reminders during read-only sessions

#### Auto Code Quality Plugin
- **Advisory test runner** now reads from the correct tmp file prefix (`claude-cq-edited` instead of `claude-edited-files`), fixing a mismatch that prevented it from ever finding edited files

#### Docs
- Removed stale merge conflict marker in first-session docs page


#### CI/CD
- **Release workflow** — switched from auto-publish on `package.json` change to tag-triggered (`v*` tags only); prevents accidental releases when PRs include version bumps. Tag must match `package.json` version or the workflow fails.

#### CCStatusLine Deployment
- **`CONFIG_SOURCE_DIR` deprecation guard** — `setup.sh` now detects stale `CONFIG_SOURCE_DIR=/workspaces/.claude` in `.env`, overrides to `$DEVCONTAINER_DIR/config`, and auto-comments the line on disk; the wrong path caused `setup-config.sh` to skip the file manifest entirely, leaving ccstatusline (and all manifest-based configs) undeployed
- **System template directory permissions** — `install.sh` now chowns `/usr/local/share/ccstatusline/` to the target user so `setup-config.sh` can write the template file during post-start
- **Silent copy failures** — `setup-config.sh` now reports warnings when file deployment fails instead of logging success after a failed `cp`

#### Post-Integration Review Fixes
- **skill-engine** — worktree skill definition uses weighted tuples (was plain strings, caused crash)
- **dangerous-command-blocker** — fail closed on unexpected exceptions (was fail-open)
- **ticket-workflow** — remove redundant `ValueError` from exception handlers
- **workspace-scope-guard** — use maxsplit in variable assignment detection
- **Shell scripts** — add executable bit to `check-setup.sh`, quote `PLUGIN_BLACKLIST` variable, add `set -uo pipefail` to tmux installer, replace deprecated `which` with `command -v`, normalize `&>` redirects in setup scripts
- **Documentation** — update agent count to 21, skill count to 38, plugin count to 14 across all docs site pages
- **Documentation** — add missing plugin pages for git-workflow and prompt-snippets
- **Documentation** — add `cc-orc` and `dbr` to commands reference
- **Documentation** — remove merge conflict marker from first-session.md
- **Documentation** — update architecture.md directory tree with new plugins

#### CodeRabbit Review Fixes
- **`implementer.md`** — changed PostToolUse hook (fires every Edit) to Stop hook (fires once at task end) with 120s timeout; prevents redundant test runs during multi-file tasks
- **`tester.md`** — increased Stop hook timeout from 30s to 120s to accommodate larger test suites
- **`setup-aliases.sh`** — added `cc-orc` to `cc-tools` discovery loop so it appears in tool audit
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — added missing `keybindings.json`, `orchestrator-system-prompt.md`, and `writing-system-prompt.md` to directory structure tree
- **`agent-system/README.md`** — updated `verify-no-regression.py` comment to list both consumers (implementer, refactorer); hyphenated "question-surfacing protocol"
- **`orchestrator-system-prompt.md`** — clarified plan mode allows investigator delegation for research; added catch-all entry in selection criteria pointing to the full specialist catalog
- **MD040 compliance** — added `text` language specifiers to 7 fenced code blocks across `investigator.md`, `tester.md`, and `documenter.md`
- **`setup.js` path traversal** — `configApply()` now validates that source paths resolve within `.codeforge/` and destination paths resolve within allowed directories (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `HOME`, `/usr/local/`), preventing directory traversal via `../` in manifest entries
- **`setup.sh` CODEFORGE_DIR** — deprecation guard now uses default-assignment semantics (`:=`) instead of unconditional overwrite, preserving any user-defined `CODEFORGE_DIR` from `.env`
- **Docs site URLs** — replaced `anexileddev.github.io/CodeForge/` with custom domain `codeforge.core-directive.com/` across README.md, CLAUDE.md, and .devcontainer/README.md
- **Architecture docs** — added `.checksums/` and `.markers/` directories to the `.codeforge/` tree in architecture.md
- **Troubleshooting docs** — renamed "Reset to Defaults" to "How to Reset" and clarified that `--reset` preserves `.codeforge/` user modifications; added step for restoring default config sources


#### Claude Code Installation
- **Update script no longer silently discards errors** — background update output now captured to log file instead of being discarded via `&>/dev/null`
- **Update script simplified to native-binary-only** — removed npm fallback and `claude install` bootstrap code; added 60s timeout and transitional npm cleanup
- **Alias resolution simplified** — `_CLAUDE_BIN` now resolves directly to native binary path (removed npm and `/usr/local/bin` fallbacks)
- **POSIX redirect** — replaced `&>/dev/null` with `>/dev/null 2>&1` in dependency check for portability
- **Installer shell** — changed `sh -s` to `bash -s` when piping the official installer (it requires bash)
- **Unquoted `${TARGET}`** — quoted variable in `su -c` command to prevent word splitting
- **Directory prep** — added `~/.local/state` and `~/.claude` pre-creation; consolidated `chown` to cover entire `~/.local` tree

#### Plugin Marketplace
- **`marketplace.json` schema fix** — changed all 11 plugin `source` fields from bare names (e.g., `"codeforge-lsp"`) to relative paths (`"./plugins/codeforge-lsp"`) so `claude plugin marketplace add` passes schema validation and all plugins register correctly

#### ChromaTerm
- **Regex lookbehinds** — replaced alternation inside lookbehinds (`(?<=[\s(]|^)` and `(?<=commit |merge |...)`) with non-capturing groups containing individual lookbehinds (`(?:(?<=[\s(])|^)` and `(?:(?<=commit )|(?<=merge )|...)`) for PCRE2 compatibility

#### Terminal Color Support
- **devcontainer.json** — added `TERM` and `COLORTERM=truecolor` to `remoteEnv`; Docker defaults to `TERM=xterm` (8 colors) which caused Claude Code and other CLI tools to downgrade rendering
- **devcontainer.json** — `TERM` uses `${localEnv:TERM:xterm-256color}` to forward the host terminal type (e.g., `xterm-kitty`) instead of unconditionally overriding it
- **setup-aliases.sh** — added terminal color defaults to managed shell block so tmux panes, `docker exec`, and SSH sessions also get 256-color and truecolor support
- **kitty-terminfo/README.md** — updated documentation to reflect `localEnv` forwarding and clarify behavior across VS Code vs non-VS Code entry points
- **CLAUDE.md** — documented `TERM` and `COLORTERM` environment variables in the Environment section

### Added

#### Startup
- **Container runtime pre-flight check** — validates Docker or Podman is installed and running before attempting to build the devcontainer; aborts with OS-specific remediation guidance (Windows/WSL, macOS, Linux) instead of a cryptic Docker client error

#### README
- **"Why CodeForge?" section** — motivation and value proposition explaining the project's origins as a power user's personal setup
- **Architecture overview** — three-layer diagram (DevContainer → CodeForge Layer → Claude Code) with brief descriptions and link to full architecture docs
- **Configuration summary** — table of key config files with links to the documentation site

#### Public Repo Quality
- **CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — test and lint jobs on PRs and pushes to main (Node 18, `npm test` + Biome check)
- **CodeQL security analysis** (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`) — JavaScript scanning on PRs, pushes, and weekly schedule
- **Dependabot** (`.github/dependabot.yml`) — weekly updates for npm (root + docs) and GitHub Actions
- **Bug report template** (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yml`) — YAML form with version, environment, and repro steps
- **Feature request template** (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-request.yml`) — YAML form with problem/solution/alternatives
- **Issue template config** (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`) — commercial licensing contact link
- **Pull request template** (`.github/pull_request_template.md`) — description, type of change, and checklist
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — contribution guidelines with GPL-3.0 licensing and CLA requirement
- **CLA.md** — Individual Contributor License Agreement enabling dual licensing
- **Dual licensing notice** — added to README.md (Contributing + License sections) and LICENSE.txt (header)
- **CI badge** — added to README.md badge row
- **SPDX copyright headers** — `GPL-3.0-only` identifier and `Copyright (c) 2026 Marcus Krueger` added to all 36 source files (setup.js, test.js, 34 shell scripts)

#### Docs
- **CLAUDE.md** — new "Status Bar Widgets" section documenting widget properties, token color conventions, label fusion pattern, and available widget types

#### Skills
- **worktree** — New skill for git worktree creation, management, and cleanup. Covers `EnterWorktree` tool, `--worktree` CLI flag, `.worktreeinclude` setup, worktree naming conventions, cleanup lifecycle, and CodeForge integration (Project Manager auto-detection, agent isolation). Includes two reference files: manual worktree commands and parallel workflow patterns.

#### Claude Code Installation
- **Post-start onboarding hook** (`99-claude-onboarding.sh`) — ensures `hasCompletedOnboarding: true` in `.claude.json` when token auth is configured; catches overwrites from Claude Code CLI/extension that race with `postStartCommand`

#### Git Workflow Plugin
- **`/ship`** — Combined commit/push/PR command with full code review, commit message approval, and AskUserQuestion confirmation before PR creation; optionally links to tickets if context exists
- **`/pr:review`** — Review any PR by number/URL or auto-detect from current branch; posts findings as PR comment with severity ratings; never approves or merges

#### Features
- **devcontainer-bridge (dbr)** — Ports opened inside the container are now automatically discovered and forwarded to the host, even outside VS Code. Requires `dbr host-daemon` running on the host. See [devcontainer-bridge](https://github.com/bradleybeddoes/devcontainer-bridge)

#### Orchestrator Mode
- **`cc-orc` alias** — new Claude Code entry point using `orchestrator-system-prompt.md` for delegation-first operation; orchestrator decomposes tasks, delegates to agents, surfaces questions, and synthesizes results without performing direct implementation work
- **`orchestrator-system-prompt.md`** — slim system prompt (~250 lines) containing only delegation model, agent catalog, question surfacing protocol, planning gates, spec enforcement, and action safety; all code standards, testing standards, and implementation details live in agent prompts

#### Workhorse Agents
- **`investigator`** — consolidated read-only research agent (sonnet) merging the domains of researcher, explorer, dependency-analyst, git-archaeologist, debug-logs, and perf-profiler; handles codebase search, web research, git forensics, dependency auditing, log analysis, and performance profiling
- **`implementer`** — consolidated read-write implementation agent (opus, worktree) merging generalist, refactorer, and migrator; handles all code modifications with embedded code standards, execution discipline, and Stop hook regression testing
- **`tester`** — enhanced test agent (opus, worktree) with full testing standards, framework-specific guidance, and Stop hook verification; creates and verifies test suites
- **`documenter`** — consolidated documentation and specification agent (opus) merging doc-writer and spec-writer; handles README, API docs, docstrings, and the full spec lifecycle (create, refine, build, review, update, check)
- **Question Surfacing Protocol** — all 4 workhorse agents carry an identical protocol requiring them to STOP and return `## BLOCKED: Questions` sections when hitting ambiguities, ensuring no assumptions are made without user input

### Changed

#### Skill Engine: Auto-Suggestion
- **Weighted scoring** — Skill suggestion phrases now carry confidence weights (0.0–1.0) instead of binary match/no-match. Specific phrases like "build a fastapi app" score 1.0; ambiguous phrases like "start building" score 0.2
- **Negative patterns** — Skills can define substrings that instantly disqualify them. Prevents `fastapi` from triggering when discussing `pydantic-ai`, and `docker` from triggering for `docker-py` prompts
- **Context guards** — Low-confidence matches (score < 0.6) require a confirming context word elsewhere in the prompt. "health check" only suggests `docker` if "docker", "container", or "compose" also appears
- **Ranked results, capped at 3** — Suggestions are sorted by score (then priority tier), and only the top 3 are returned. Eliminates 6+ skill suggestion floods
- **Priority tiers** — Explicit commands (priority 10) outrank technology skills (7), which outrank patterns (5) and generic skills (3) when scores tie

#### Claude Code Installation
- **Claude Code now installs as a native binary** — uses Anthropic's official installer (`https://claude.ai/install.sh`) via new `./features/claude-code-native` feature, replacing the npm-based `ghcr.io/anthropics/devcontainer-features/claude-code:1.0.5`
- **In-session auto-updater now works without root** — native binary at `~/.local/bin/claude` is owned by the container user, so `claude update` succeeds without permission issues

#### System Prompt
- **`<git_worktrees>` section** — Updated to document Claude Code native worktree convention (`<repo>/.claude/worktrees/`) as the recommended approach alongside the legacy `.worktrees/` convention. Added `EnterWorktree` tool guidance, `.worktreeinclude` file documentation, and path convention comparison table.

#### Configuration
- Moved `.claude` directory from `/workspaces/.claude` to `~/.claude` (home directory)
- Added Docker named volume for persistence across rebuilds (per-instance isolation via `${devcontainerId}`)
- `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` now defaults to `~/.claude`
- `file-manifest.json` — added deployment entry for `orchestrator-system-prompt.md`
- `setup-aliases.sh` — added `cc-orc` alias alongside existing `cc`, `claude`, `ccw`, `ccraw`
- `CLAUDE.md` — documented `cc-orc` command and orchestrator system prompt in key configuration table

#### Agent System
- Agent count increased from 17 to 21 (4 workhorse + 17 specialist)
- Agent-system README updated with workhorse agent table, per-agent hooks for implementer and tester, and updated plugin structure

#### Authentication
- Added `CLAUDE_AUTH_TOKEN` support in `.secrets` for long-lived tokens from `claude setup-token`
- Auto-creates `.credentials.json` from token on container start (skips if already exists)
- Added `CLAUDE_AUTH_TOKEN` to devcontainer.json secrets declaration

#### Security
- Protected-files-guard now blocks modifications to `.credentials.json`
- Replaced `eval` tilde expansion with `getent passwd` lookup across all scripts (prevents shell injection via `SUDO_USER`/`USER`)
- Auth token value is now JSON-escaped before writing to `.credentials.json`
- Credential directory created with restrictive umask (700) matching credential file permissions (600)

#### Status Bar
- **ccstatusline line 1** — distinct background colors for each token widget (blue=input, magenta=output, yellow=cached, green=total), bold 2-char labels (In, Ou, Ca, Tt) fused to data widgets, `rawValue: true` on model widget to strip "Model:" prefix, restored spacing between token segments

#### Scripts
- Replaced `setup-symlink-claude.sh` with `setup-migrate-claude.sh` (one-time migration)
- Auto-migrates from `/workspaces/.claude/` if `.credentials.json` present
- `chown` in mcp-qdrant poststart hooks now uses resolved `_USERNAME` instead of hardcoded `vscode` or `$(id -un)`
- **Migration script hardened** — switched from `cp -rn` to `cp -a` (archive mode); added marker-based idempotency, critical file verification, ownership fixup, and old-directory rename
- **`.env` deprecation guard** — `setup.sh` detects stale `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/workspaces/.claude` in `.env`, overrides to `$HOME/.claude`, and auto-comments the line on disk

#### Documentation
- All docs now reference `~/.claude` as default config path
- Added `CLAUDE_AUTH_TOKEN` setup flow to README, configuration reference, and troubleshooting
- ccstatusline README verification commands now respect `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`

### Removed

#### Scripts
- `setup-symlink-claude.sh` — no longer needed with native home directory location

#### VS Code Extensions
- **Todo+** (`fabiospampinato.vscode-todo-plus`) — removed from devcontainer extensions

## [v2.0.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

#### .codeforge/ User Customization Directory
- New `.codeforge/` directory centralizes all user-customizable configuration files
- Checksum-based modification detection preserves user changes during updates
- `codeforge config apply` CLI command deploys config files to `~/.claude/` (same as container start)
- Auto-migration from `.devcontainer/config/defaults/` to `.codeforge/config/` for existing users
- `.codeforge/.codeforge-preserve` for listing additional files to preserve during updates

### Changed

#### Configuration
- Config files moved from `.devcontainer/config/defaults/` to `.codeforge/config/`
- File manifest moved from `.devcontainer/config/file-manifest.json` to `.codeforge/file-manifest.json`
- Terminal connection scripts moved from `.devcontainer/` to `.codeforge/scripts/`
- `CONFIG_SOURCE_DIR` env var deprecated in favor of `CODEFORGE_DIR`
- `--force` updates now use checksum comparison for `.codeforge/` files (writes `.default` instead of `.codeforge-new`)
- `--reset` preserves `.codeforge/` user modifications (only `.devcontainer/` is wiped)

#### Migration
- v2 migration marker moved to `.codeforge/.markers/v2-migrated`
- Container start auto-migrates `.devcontainer/config/defaults/` to `.codeforge/config/` if needed

## [v1.14.2] - 2026-02-24

### Added

#### Prompt Snippets Plugin
- **New plugin: `prompt-snippets`** — single `/ps` slash command for quick behavioral mode switches (noaction, brief, plan, go, review, ship, deep, hold, recall, wait)
- Snippets inject short directives that persist for the conversation (e.g., `/ps noaction` → "Investigate and report only. Take no action.")
- Composable: `/ps noaction brief` applies multiple snippets at once
- Isolated from skill-engine auto-suggestion (`disable-model-invocation: true`) and independently toggleable via `enabledPlugins`

### Changed

#### Docs
- **First Session page** — trimmed from 198 to 128 lines by consolidating "What Happens Automatically" into a concise summary, replacing full agent/skill tables with brief teasers linking to their dedicated pages
- **Installation Troubleshooting** — expanded from 4 to 10 FAQ entries covering `npx` failures, VS Code extension issues, Docker permissions on Linux, WSL 2 integration, port conflicts, and slow rebuilds

### Fixed

#### CI: Release Workflow (v1.14.1)
- **test.js** — settings.json path updated from `config/settings.json` to `config/defaults/settings.json` to match config externalization refactor
- **test.js** — Test 5 (executable check) result now included in exit condition; previously a failure was logged but did not affect the exit code
- **setup.js** — file permissions changed from 644 to 755 (executable) to match shebang and `bin` declaration in package.json

#### CI: Publish DevContainer Features Workflow (v1.14.1)
- **features/README.md** — removed from features directory; `devcontainers/action@v1` treated it as a feature subdirectory and failed looking for `README.md/devcontainer-feature.json`
- **11 devcontainer-feature.json files** — removed `"maintainer"` field (not in the DevContainer Feature spec schema, causing strict validation failure): ast-grep, ccburn, ccms, ccstatusline, ccusage, chromaterm, claude-monitor, claude-session-dashboard, lsp-servers, mcp-qdrant, tree-sitter

#### CI: Publish DevContainer Features Workflow (v1.14.2)
- **6 devcontainer-feature.json files** — removed `"proposals"` field that coexisted with `"enum"` on the same option (spec schema treats them as mutually exclusive via `anyOf`): ccburn, ccusage, claude-monitor, claude-session-dashboard, mcp-qdrant, tree-sitter

#### Docs
- **Active sidebar item** — increased background opacity from 0.08 to 0.14, added `font-weight: 600` and `color: var(--sl-color-accent-high)` for readable contrast against inactive items
- **Stale skill counts** — 5 pages (First Session, Getting Started index, Features index) referenced "21 skills" instead of the correct total of 34 across all plugins (skill-engine: 21, spec-workflow: 8, ticket-workflow: 4, agent-system: 1)

## [v1.14.0] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed (CodeRabbit review)
- **chromaterm/install.sh** — username auto-detection now resets to empty before candidate loop, so `${USERNAME:-root}` fallback works correctly
- **biome/install.sh** — nvm.sh sourcing wrapped in `set +u` / `set -u` to prevent unbound variable abort under `set -euo pipefail`
- **setup.js** — `ccstatusline-settings.json` added to DEFAULT_PRESERVE so user customizations survive `--force` package updates
- **docs agent-system.md** — spec-writer moved from Full-Access to Read-Only agents table (matches its `permissionMode: plan` definition)
- **guard-readonly-bash.py** — docstring corrected from "Returns JSON on stdout" to "Outputs block reason to stderr"
- **git-forensics/SKILL.md** — misleading "Blame through renames" comment fixed to "Show patch history through renames"

### Added

#### Nuclear Workspace Scope Enforcement
- **Blacklist system** — `/workspaces/.devcontainer/` permanently blocked for ALL operations (read, write, bash). Checked before allowlist, scope check, and cwd bypass. Cannot be overridden, even from workspace root
- **Bash enforcement** — two-layer detection in `guard-workspace-scope.py`:
  - Layer 1: 20+ regex patterns extract write targets (`>`, `tee`, `cp`, `mv`, `touch`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `ln`, `rsync`, `chmod`, `chown`, `dd`, `wget -O`, `curl -o`, `tar -C`, `unzip -d`, `gcc -o`, `sqlite3`). System command exemption only when ALL targets resolve to system paths
  - Layer 2: regex scans entire command for any `/workspaces/` path string — catches inline scripts, variable assignments, quoted paths. No exemptions, always runs
- **CWD context injector** (`inject-workspace-cwd.py`) — fires on SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, SubagentStart to reinforce working directory scope
- **Fail-closed error handling** — JSON parse errors, exceptions, and unknown tools now exit 2 (block) instead of exit 0 (allow)

#### Agent System Enhancements
- **`task-completed-check.py`** — quality gate hook (TaskCompleted) runs test suite before allowing task completion
- **`teammate-idle-check.py`** — quality gate hook (TeammateIdle) prevents teammates from going idle with incomplete tasks
- **`skills/debug/SKILL.md`** — structured log investigation skill replacing the old `/debug` slash command
- **`permissionMode`** declared on all 17 agent definitions (plan for read-only, default for write-capable)
- **Agent-system README** — full plugin documentation with hook lifecycle, agent table, quality gates

#### Skill Engine Enhancements
- **6 new skill matchers** in `skill-suggester.py`: `spec-check`, `spec-init`, `spec-new`, `spec-refine`, `spec-update`, `team`
- **Team skill expanded** (v0.2.0) — quality gate hooks, plan approval workflow, keyboard shortcuts, use case examples, best practices, limitations
- **Skill-engine README** — full plugin documentation

#### New Features
- **chromaterm** — terminal output colorizer via ChromaTerm2 YAML rules
- **kitty-terminfo** — xterm-kitty terminfo for Kitty terminal compatibility

#### Documentation Site
- **Astro/Starlight docs** (`docs/`) — full documentation portal with getting-started guides, plugin reference (12 pages), feature docs, customization, and API reference
- **GitHub Actions** — `deploy-docs.yml` (docs deployment), `publish-features.yml` (GHCR feature publishing), `release.yml` (release workflow)
- **Logos** — CodeForgeLogo.png, CodeForgeLogoTr.png, github-avatar.png

#### Plugin Installation Documentation
- **Remote install instructions** added to all 11 plugin READMEs — "From GitHub" section with clone + enabledPlugins setup from `https://github.com/AnExiledDev/CodeForge`
- **GHCR feature paths** — features README updated with `ghcr.io/anexileddev/codeforge/<feature-name>:<version>` and devcontainer.json usage examples
- **READMEs added** to session-context, skill-engine, spec-workflow plugins
- **Install sections added** to workspace-scope-guard, codeforge-lsp, dangerous-command-blocker, protected-files-guard, notify-hook, ticket-workflow

#### Other
- **Marketplace metadata** — `marketplace.json` restructured with `metadata` object, `pluginRoot`, and `keywords` arrays for all plugins
- **Port forwarding** for Claude Dashboard (port 7847) in devcontainer.json
- **ChromaTerm wrapper** in setup-aliases.sh — `cc`/`claude`/`ccw` aliases pipe through `ct` when available
- **`package.json` scripts** — added `prepublishOnly`, `docs:dev`, `docs:build`, `docs:preview`

#### ccstatusline Config Externalization
- **Widget config extracted** from inline `jq -n` generation in `install.sh` into `config/defaults/ccstatusline-settings.json` — editable JSON file, single source of truth
- **File-manifest deployment** — two new entries deploy the config to `~/.config/ccstatusline/settings.json` (if-changed) and `/usr/local/share/ccstatusline/settings.template.json` (always)
- **`${HOME}` variable expansion** added to `setup-config.sh` — enables manifest entries targeting user home directory paths

#### Development Rules
- **CLAUDE.md** (project root) — added changelog and documentation update rules: all changes must have a changelog entry and update relevant docs

### Changed

#### ccstatusline Feature
- `install.sh` simplified — removed ~90 lines of inline JSON config generation, validation, and template creation. Config deployment now handled by file-manifest system

#### Workspace Scope Guard
- Reads (Read, Glob, Grep) now **hard-blocked** outside scope — upgraded from warning (exit 0) to block (exit 2)
- Allowlist trimmed to `/workspaces/.claude/` and `/tmp/` only — removed `/workspaces/.devcontainer/`, `/workspaces/.tmp/`, `/home/vscode/`
- Hook timeout increased from 5s to 10s
- Matcher expanded to include Bash tool

#### Hook Output Schema Migration
- All hooks migrated to `hookSpecificOutput` wrapper with explicit `hookEventName`
- `commit-reminder.py` — upgraded from advisory to blocking (`decision: block`)
- `spec-reminder.py` — upgraded from advisory to blocking (`decision: block`)
- `advisory-test-runner.py` — test failures now block with `decision: block`; passes/timeouts use `systemMessage`
- `ticket-linker.py` — output wrapped in `hookSpecificOutput`
- `git-state-injector.py`, `todo-harvester.py` — output wrapped in `hookSpecificOutput`

#### Ticket Workflow
- Migrated from slash commands to skill-based approach — 4 slash commands and system-prompt.md replaced by skills directory

- All 21+ SKILL.md files rewritten with USE WHEN / DO NOT USE guidance, action-oriented descriptions, bumped to v0.2.0
- `skill-suggester.py` keyword maps overhauled with natural phrases and concrete identifiers
- Skill suggestion output changed to mandatory directive format
- SubagentStart hook removed — suggestions now fire on UserPromptSubmit only

#### Error Output
- `block-dangerous.py` — errors now written to stderr (was JSON on stdout)
- `guard-protected.py`, `guard-protected-bash.py` — errors now written to stderr

#### Features
- `ccstatusline` — compact 3-line layout (was 8-line), `rawValue: true` on token widgets
- `claude-session-dashboard` — default port 3000 → 7847, `--host 0.0.0.0` for external access
- `ccms` — build cache moved from `.devcontainer/.build-cache/` to `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/ccms-build-cache`

#### Configuration
- `CLAUDE.md` (devcontainer) — condensed from ~308 to ~90 lines, removed redundant sections
- `spec-workflow.md` rule — condensed, defers to system prompt `<specification_management>` section
- `main-system-prompt.md` — expanded Agent Teams guidance: file ownership, task sizing, quality gate hooks, plan approval
- Plugin `plugin.json` files — `version` field removed across all plugins

### Fixed
- Stale references to deleted features (mcp-reasoner, splitrail, claude-code) removed from docs
- Documentation counts updated (features: 21, agents: 17, skills: 34)
- Version mismatch in README.md corrected

- setup-projects.sh: suppress background inotifywait output
- agent-system: add missing `verify-tests-pass.py` and `verify-no-regression.py` (referenced by agent defs)

### Added

#### Plugin Architecture: Focused Plugins
- **`agent-system` plugin** — 17 custom agents with built-in agent redirection, CWD injection, and read-only bash enforcement
- **`skill-engine` plugin** — 21 coding skills with auto-suggestion hook
- **`spec-workflow` plugin** — 8 spec lifecycle skills with spec-reminder hook
- **`session-context` plugin** — session boundary hooks (git state injection, TODO harvesting, commit reminders)

#### Other
- **`ticket-workflow` hooks** — auto-links GitHub issue/PR references in user prompts via `ticket-linker.py`
- **`auto-code-quality` advisory test runner** — runs affected tests at Stop via `advisory-test-runner.py`
- **`/team` skill** — agent team creation and management with specialist catalog (in `skill-engine`)
- **`claude-session-dashboard` feature** — local analytics dashboard for Claude Code sessions (token usage, tool calls, cost estimates, activity heatmaps). Installed globally via npm with `claude-dashboard` command. Settings persist across rebuilds via symlink to `/workspaces/.claude-dashboard/`

### Changed

- Plugin architecture: `code-directive` monolith replaced by focused plugins (`agent-system`, `skill-engine`, `spec-workflow`, `session-context`)
- `auto-code-quality` now consolidates `auto-formatter` + `auto-linter` (disabled separately, `auto-code-quality` is the superset)
- **`workspace-scope.md` rule hardened** — strict enforcement with no exceptions; all file operations must target paths within the current project directory

### Removed

- `code-directive` plugin (replaced by `agent-system`, `skill-engine`, `spec-workflow`, `session-context`)
- `auto-formatter` and `auto-linter` disabled in settings (consolidated into `auto-code-quality`)

---

## [v1.12.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

#### Plugin README Documentation
- **9 new README files** for all marketplace plugins: auto-formatter, auto-linter, code-directive, codeforge-lsp, dangerous-command-blocker, notify-hook, protected-files-guard, ticket-workflow, workspace-scope-guard. Each documents purpose, hook lifecycle, protected patterns, and plugin structure

#### Protected Files Guard: Bash Hook
- **`guard-protected-bash.py`** — new PreToolUse/Bash hook blocking bash commands that write to protected file paths (companion to existing Edit/Write guard). Covers `>`, `>>`, `tee`, `cp`, `mv`, `sed -i` targeting `.env`, lock files, `.git`, certificates, and credentials

#### Devcontainer Secrets Declaration
- **`secrets` block** in devcontainer.json declaring `GH_TOKEN`, `NPM_TOKEN`, `GH_USERNAME`, `GH_EMAIL` with documentation URLs for VS Code Codespaces/devcontainer secret management

#### Post-Start Hook System
- **`run_poststart_hooks()`** in setup.sh — runs executable `.sh` scripts from `/usr/local/devcontainer-poststart.d/`; controlled by `SETUP_POSTSTART` env flag (default: true)

#### Git Worktree Support
- **System prompt `<git_worktrees>` section** — layout convention, creation commands, project detection, and safety rules
- **CLAUDE.md documentation** — full worktree section with layout, creation, detection, and compatibility details
- **setup-projects.sh** — `.worktrees/` explicit scanning at depth 3, `.git` file detection via `gitdir:` check, `"worktree"` tag in Project Manager
- **protected-files-guard** — `.git` regex updated from `\.git/` to `\.git(/|$)` to cover worktree `.git` pointer files

#### Other
- **`CLAUDECODE=null` env var** — unsets the detection flag in `remoteEnv` to allow nested Claude Code sessions (claude-in-claude)
- **Go runtime option** — commented-out `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/go:1` entry in devcontainer.json for easy opt-in

### Changed

#### Feature Version Pinning
- All local features pinned from `"latest"` to explicit versions: agent-browser `0.11.1`, ast-grep `0.40.5`, biome `2.4.2`, ruff `0.15.1`, pyright `1.1.408`, typescript-language-server `5.1.3`, TypeScript `5.9.3`
- External features pinned to minor versions: node `1.6`, github-cli `1.0`, docker-outside-of-docker `1.7`, uv `1.0`, rust `1.4`, claude-code `1.1`

#### Default Shell: bash → zsh
- VS Code terminal default profile changed from bash to zsh
- Explicit `zsh` profile added to terminal profile list
- Claude Teams tmux profile shell changed from bash to zsh

#### Security Hardening
- **dangerous-command-blocker** — 7 new blocked patterns: Docker container escape (`--privileged`, host root mount), destructive Docker ops (`stop/rm/kill/rmi`), bare force push (no branch specified), `find -exec rm`, `find -delete`, `git clean -f`, `rm -rf ../`. JSON parse failures now fail closed (exit 2 instead of 0)
- **protected-files-guard** — JSON parse failures fail closed (exit 2 instead of 0)

#### Build & Setup
- **ccms build cache** — install.sh checks `.build-cache/bin/ccms` before cargo building; caches binary after first build for faster rebuilds; pinned to commit `f90d259a4476`
- **setup.sh** — `setup-update-claude.sh` now runs in background (non-blocking container start); script failure output displayed for diagnostics; new `background` status indicator in summary
- **inotify-tools moved to build time** — tmux feature installs inotify-tools via apt at build; setup-projects.sh no longer attempts runtime apt-get install
- **Container memory** — recommended from 4GB/8GB to 6GB/12GB in troubleshooting docs

#### Writing System Prompt
- New **Emotional Architecture** section — cognitive-emotional loop, controlled emotion principle, autism framing for POV characters
- Expanded metaphor guidance — secondary sources beyond primary domain, "would he think this?" test
- Refined show-don't-tell rules — naming emotion permitted when it adds weight, brief internal processing after major events required
- Character profile additions — emotional architecture and trigger fields

#### Other
- **connect-external-terminal.ps1** — tmux session directory respects `WORKSPACE_ROOT` env var with fallback
- **setup-projects.sh** — inotifywait exclude pattern narrowed from `\.git/` to `\.git` for worktree compatibility
- **README.md** — 5 new badges (changelog, last commit, npm downloads, Node.js, issues), updated tool/feature/skill counts, added Rust/Bun/ccw, changelog section
- **CLAUDE.md** — expanded ccw description, fixed Bun registry reference, documented setup-auth.sh/check-setup.sh, added CLAUDECODE/env flags/experimental vars/git worktrees/rules system sections, skill count 17→28
- **Documentation** — `SETUP_TERMINAL`/`SETUP_POSTSTART` in configuration reference, `CLAUDECODE=null` env var, workspace-scope-guard in plugins.md
- **Agent definitions** — minor path/prompt fixes across 8 agents (claude-guide, debug-logs, dependency-analyst, explorer, generalist, git-archaeologist, researcher, security-auditor)
- **.gitignore** — added `.build-cache/` exclusion

### Removed

- **mcp-reasoner feature** — entire feature directory deleted (README, devcontainer-feature.json, install.sh, poststart-hook.sh)
- **splitrail feature** — entire feature directory deleted (README, devcontainer-feature.json, install.sh)

---

## [v1.11.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

#### New Feature: ccms (Session History Search)
- **`ccms` devcontainer feature** — Rust-based CLI for searching Claude Code session JSONL files. Installed via `cargo install`. Supports boolean queries, role filtering, time scoping, project isolation, and JSON output
- **`session-search.md` rule** — global rule requiring project-scoped `ccms` usage and documenting CLI flags/query syntax
- **Rust runtime** — added `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/rust:1` as a devcontainer feature (required by ccms)
- **System prompt `<session_search>` section** — inline reference for ccms usage with key flags and examples
- **Context management updated** — `<context_management>` now references ccms as the primary recovery tool for compacted sessions (three-source recovery: session history → source files → plan/requirement files)

#### New Feature: ccw (Writing Mode)
- **`ccw` alias** — launches Claude with `writing-system-prompt.md` for creative-writing tasks
- **`writing-system-prompt.md`** — dedicated system prompt for writing mode, distributed via file-manifest

#### New Plugin: workspace-scope-guard
- **`workspace-scope-guard`** — safety plugin that blocks writes and warns on reads outside the working directory. Registered in marketplace.json and enabled by default in settings.json

#### New Skills: spec-build, spec-review (code-directive plugin — 28 skills total)
- **`/spec-build`** — orchestrates the full implementation lifecycle from an approved spec: plan, build, review, and close in one pass. 5-phase workflow with acceptance criteria markers (`[ ]` → `[~]` → `[x]`)
- **`/spec-review`** — standalone deep implementation review against a spec. Reads code, verifies requirements and acceptance criteria, recommends `/spec-update` when done

#### New Hook: inject-cwd.py
- **`inject-cwd.py`** (PostToolUse, all tools) — injects current working directory into every tool response via `additionalContext`

#### Status Line: CWD Widget
- **`ccstatusline-cwd`** — new custom-command widget showing the basename of Claude Code's working directory. Layout expanded from 7 to 8 lines (16 → 17 widgets)

### Changed

#### setup-aliases.sh Idempotency Fix
- **Block-marker strategy** — replaced cleanup+guard approach (which left aliases missing on re-run) with a delete-and-rewrite strategy using `START`/`END` block markers. The managed block is removed wholesale by sed range match, then always re-written fresh — no guard/`continue` needed
- **Legacy cleanup expanded** — added removal of v1.10.0 orphaned aliases/exports/`_CLAUDE_BIN`/`cc-tools()` that existed outside block markers, in addition to pre-v1.10.0 function forms
- **cc-tools expanded** — added `ccw`, `ccms`, `cargo` to the tool listing

#### Spec Workflow: Version-Based → Domain-Based Organization
- **Directory structure** — specs now live in domain subfolders (`.specs/{domain}/{feature}.md`) instead of version directories (`.specs/v0.1.0/feature.md`)
- **ROADMAP.md → MILESTONES.md** — version tracker renamed to milestone tracker throughout all skills, templates, and system prompt
- **`**Version:**` → `**Domain:**`** — spec template metadata field renamed across spec-new template, spec-writer agent, specification-writing skill, spec-update, spec-check
- **`roadmap-template.md` → `milestones-template.md`** — reference template replaced
- **Acceptance criteria markers** — three-state progress tracking: `[ ]` (not started), `[~]` (implemented, not yet verified), `[x]` (verified). Used by `/spec-build` phases and recognized by `/spec-check` and `/spec-update`
- **Spec lifecycle expanded** — `/spec-review` inserted before `/spec-update` in the recommended post-implementation workflow. `spec-reminder.py` advisory message updated accordingly
- **Agent skill lists** — architect, generalist, and spec-writer agents gained `/spec-review` access

#### LSP Plugin: Declarative Server Configuration
- **`codeforge-lsp/plugin.json`** — added `lspServers` block with pyright (Python), typescript-language-server (JS/TS), and gopls (Go) declarative configurations replacing implicit setup

#### git-state-injector.py Enhancements
- **Working directory injection** — always outputs cwd with scope restriction message, even outside git repos
- **cwd from hook input** — reads `cwd` from Claude Code's hook JSON input (falls back to `os.getcwd()`)

#### System Prompt Formatting
- **Line unwrapping** — long wrapped lines consolidated to single lines throughout (no content changes, only formatting)

#### Documentation
- **CLAUDE.md** — added `ccw`, `ccms` commands; added `writing-system-prompt.md` to directory tree and config table; added workspace-scope-guard to plugin list; skill count 17 → 28; added Rust to `version: "none"` support; updated setup-aliases.sh description
- **README.md** — added Safety Plugins section; updated spec workflow commands/lifecycle/structure for domain-based organization; added `/spec-build` and `/spec-review` to skill table; fixed system prompt override path (`system-prompt.md` → `main-system-prompt.md`)
- **claude-guide agent** — fixed system prompt path reference (`system-prompt.md` → `main-system-prompt.md`)
- **doc-writer agent** — "Version ships" → "Milestone ships" terminology
- **marketplace.json** — skill count updated (16 → 28); workspace-scope-guard added
- **skill-suggester.py** — added keyword mappings for `spec-build` and `spec-review`
- **spec-workflow.md rule** — added `/spec-build` and `/spec-review` rules (#10, #11); added acceptance criteria markers section; updated directory convention to domain-based

### Removed

- **`spec-init/references/roadmap-template.md`** — replaced by `milestones-template.md`

---

## [v1.10.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added

#### New Skill: spec-refine (code-directive plugin — 26 skills total)
- **`/spec-refine`** — iterative 6-phase spec refinement: assumption mining, requirement validation (`[assumed]` → `[user-approved]`), acceptance criteria review, scope audit, and final approval gate

#### setup-terminal.sh
- New setup script configures VS Code Shift+Enter keybinding for Claude Code multi-line terminal input (idempotent, merges into existing keybindings.json)

### Changed

#### Native Binary Preference
- **setup-aliases.sh** — introduces `_CLAUDE_BIN` variable resolution: prefers `~/.local/bin/claude` (official `claude install` location), falls back to `/usr/local/bin/claude`, then PATH. All aliases (`cc`, `claude`, `ccraw`) use `"$_CLAUDE_BIN"`
- **setup-update-claude.sh** — complete rewrite: delegates to `claude install` (first run) and `claude update` (subsequent starts) instead of manual binary download/checksum/swap. Logs to `/tmp/claude-update.log`

#### Smart Test Selection
- **advisory-test-runner.py** — rewritten to run only affected tests based on edited files. Maps source files to test files (pytest directory mirroring, vitest `--related`, jest `--findRelatedTests`, Go package mapping). Timeout reduced from 60s to 15s. Skips entirely if no files edited
- **hooks.json** — advisory-test-runner timeout reduced from 65s to 20s

#### Two-Level Project Detection
- **setup-projects.sh** — two-pass scanning: depth-1 directories with project markers registered directly; directories without markers treated as containers and children scanned. Recursive inotifywait with noise exclusion. Clean process group shutdown

#### Spec Approval Workflow
- **spec-writer agent** — adds `**Approval:** draft` field, requires `[assumed]` tagging on all requirements, adds `## Resolved Questions` section, references `/spec-refine` before implementation
- **spec-new skill** — pre-fills `**Approval:** draft`, notes features should come from backlog
- **spec-check skill** — adds Unapproved (high) and Assumed Requirements (medium) issue checks, Approval column in health table, approval summary
- **spec-update skill** — minor alignment with approval workflow
- **spec-init templates** — backlog template expanded with P0–P3 priority grades + Infrastructure section; roadmap template rewritten with pull-from-backlog workflow
- **specification-writing skill** — updated with approval field and requirement tagging guidance

#### Spec Workflow Completeness
- **spec-workflow.md (global rule)** — softened 200-line hard cap to "aim for ~200"; added approval workflow rules (spec-refine gate, requirement tags, spec-reminder hook); added `**Approval:**` and `## Resolved Questions` to standard template
- **main-system-prompt.md** — softened 4× hard "≤200 lines" references to "~200 lines"
- **spec-new skill** — fixed "capped at 200" internal contradiction; added explanation of what `/spec-refine` does and why
- **spec-new template** — added Approval Workflow section explaining `[assumed]`/`[user-approved]` tags and `draft`/`user-approved` status
- **spec-update skill** — added approval gate warning for draft specs; added spec-reminder hook documentation; added approval validation to checklist
- **spec-check skill** — added `implemented + draft` (High) and `inconsistent approval` (High) checks
- **spec-init skill** — expanded next-steps with full lifecycle (backlog → roadmap → spec → refine → implement → update → check)
- **spec-reminder.py** — added `/spec-refine` mention in advisory message for draft specs

#### Documentation Sizing
- **Relaxed 200-line hard cap** to "aim for ~200 lines" across global rule, system prompt, spec-new skill, architect agent, doc-writer agent, documentation-patterns skill, and spec-check skill

#### Other
- **setup.sh** — added `SETUP_TERMINAL` flag, normalized update-claude invocation via `run_script` helper
- **check-setup.sh** — removed checks for disabled features (shfmt, shellcheck, hadolint, dprint); checks RC files for alias instead of `type cc`
- **connect-external-terminal.sh** — uses `${WORKSPACE_ROOT:-/workspaces}` instead of hardcoded path
- **devcontainer.json** — formatting normalization
- **main-system-prompt.md** — updates for spec approval workflow and requirement tagging

### Removed
- **test-project/README.md** — deleted (no longer needed)

---

## [v1.9.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added

#### Agent Context Inheritance (code-directive plugin)
- **Project Context Discovery** — all 14 project-interacting agents now read `.claude/rules/*.md` and CLAUDE.md files before starting work. Agents walk up the directory tree from their working directory to the workspace root, applying conventions from each level (deeper files take precedence)
- **Execution Discipline** — 7 agents (generalist, refactorer, migrator, test-writer, doc-writer, architect, researcher) gain structured pre/post-work verification: read before writing, verify after writing, no silent deviations, failure diagnosis before retry
- **Code Standards** — 5 agents (generalist full; refactorer, migrator, test-writer, architect compact) gain SOLID, DRY/KISS/YAGNI, function size limits, error handling rules, and forbidden patterns (god classes, magic numbers, dead code)
- **Professional Objectivity** — 10 agents gain explicit instruction to prioritize technical accuracy over agreement, present evidence when it conflicts with assumptions
- **Communication Standards** — all 14 agents gain response brevity rules: substance-first responses, no preamble, explicit uncertainty marking, file:line references
- **Documentation Convention** — 2 write agents (generalist, migrator) gain inline comment guidance (explain "why", not "what")
- **Context Management** — generalist gains instruction to continue working normally when context runs low
- **Testing Guidance** — generalist gains testing standards (verify behavior not implementation, max 3 mocks per test)
- **Scope Discipline** — refactorer gains explicit constraint: never expand scope beyond the requested refactoring
- **Tiered approach**: Tier 1 (generalist, 139→268 lines, all blocks), Tier 2 (4 write agents, full blocks), Tier 3 (9 read-only agents, compact blocks). 3 agents skipped (bash-exec, claude-guide, statusline-config — no project context needed)

#### Specification Workflow System (code-directive plugin — 4 new skills, 25 total)
- **`/spec-new`** — creates a new spec from the standard template in `.specs/`
- **`/spec-update`** — performs as-built spec update after implementation (checks off criteria, adds implementation notes, updates paths)
- **`/spec-check`** — audits spec health: stale specs, missing coverage, orphaned files
- **`/spec-init`** — bootstraps `.specs/` directory structure for projects that don't have one
- **`spec-reminder.py`** `[Stop]` — new advisory hook reminds about spec updates when implementation work is detected
- **Spec skills assigned to agents** — generalist and spec-writer agents gain spec skill access in frontmatter

#### Default Rules Distribution
- **`config/defaults/rules/`** — new directory containing default `.claude/rules/` files distributed to all projects via file-manifest
- **`spec-workflow.md`** — rule enforcing spec-before-implementation workflow, ≤200 line spec limit, `.specs/` directory convention, as-built update requirement
- **`workspace-scope.md`** — rule restricting file operations to the current project directory

#### New Plugin: auto-code-quality
- **Self-contained code quality plugin** — combines auto-formatter + auto-linter into a single drop-in plugin with independent temp file namespace (`claude-cq-*`). Includes all 7 formatters (Ruff, Biome, gofmt, shfmt, dprint, rustfmt, Black fallback) and 7 linters (Pyright, Ruff, Biome, ShellCheck, go vet, hadolint, clippy) plus syntax validation. Designed for use outside the CodeForge devcontainer where auto-formatter and auto-linter aren't available separately

### Changed

#### Config System
- **`file-manifest.json`** — added 2 new entries for default rules files (`defaults/rules/spec-workflow.md`, `defaults/rules/workspace-scope.md`) targeting `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/rules`
- **`setup-config.sh` bug fix** — fixed bash field-collapse bug where empty `destFilename` caused subsequent fields to shift. Uses `__NONE__` sentinel in jq output to prevent `read` from collapsing consecutive tab delimiters

#### Plugin References
- **`frontend-design` plugin name corrected** — fixed `frontend-design@claude-code-plugins` → `frontend-design@claude-plugins-official` in both `settings.json` and `CLAUDE.md`

#### Code-Directive Plugin
- **`hooks.json`** — added `spec-reminder.py` to Stop hooks (now 3 Stop hooks: advisory-test-runner, commit-reminder, spec-reminder)
- **`marketplace.json`** — added `auto-code-quality` plugin entry (10 plugins total, was 9)
- **Agent definitions** — 14 of 17 agents updated with orchestrator-mirrored instructions (see Agent Context Inheritance above)

#### Formatting
- **Whitespace normalization** — `settings.json`, `file-manifest.json`, `marketplace.json`, `hooks.json`, `package.json`, `setup-config.sh` reformatted to consistent tab indentation

---

## [v1.8.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added

#### Config System: Declarative File Manifest
- **`config/file-manifest.json`** — new declarative manifest controlling which config files are copied and how. Replaces hardcoded `copy_file` calls with per-file `overwrite` modes: `"if-changed"` (sha256-based, default), `"always"`, or `"never"`
- **`config/defaults/`** — config files relocated from `config/` to `config/defaults/` (settings.json, keybindings.json, main-system-prompt.md)
- **`setup-config.sh` rewritten** — reads file-manifest.json, supports variable expansion (`${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}`, `${WORKSPACE_ROOT}`), sha256-based change detection, and legacy fallback if manifest is missing

#### Features
- **ruff feature** — Python formatter/linter via `uv tool install ruff`; replaces Black as primary Python formatter (Black kept as fallback)
- **shfmt feature** — Shell script formatter via direct binary download from GitHub releases; supports `.sh`, `.bash`, `.zsh`, `.mksh`, `.bats`
- **dprint feature** — Pluggable formatter for Markdown, YAML, TOML, and Dockerfile via GitHub releases binary; ships global config at `/usr/local/share/dprint/dprint.json` with four plugins (markdown, yaml, toml, dockerfile)
- **shellcheck feature** — Shell script linter via `apt-get install`; JSON output parsing for structured diagnostics
- **hadolint feature** — Dockerfile linter via direct binary download from GitHub releases; JSON output parsing

#### Formatter Coverage (format-on-stop.py)
- **Ruff formatter** — `.py`/`.pyi` files now formatted with Ruff (falls back to Black if Ruff not installed)
- **Biome expanded** — added `.css`, `.json`, `.jsonc`, `.graphql`, `.gql`, `.html`, `.vue`, `.svelte`, `.astro` (was JS/TS only; now 18 extensions total)
- **shfmt integration** — `.sh`, `.bash`, `.zsh`, `.mksh`, `.bats` files auto-formatted on Stop
- **dprint integration** — `.md`, `.markdown`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.toml` files and `Dockerfile`/`.dockerfile` auto-formatted on Stop
- **rustfmt integration** — `.rs` files auto-formatted if `rustfmt` is in PATH (conditional, zero overhead when unused)

#### Linter Coverage (lint-file.py)
- **Ruff linter** — Python files now checked by both Pyright (type checking) and Ruff (style/correctness); complementary, not redundant
- **Biome lint** — JS/TS/CSS/GraphQL files linted via `biome lint --reporter=json`; surfaces unsafe diagnostics not auto-fixed by formatter
- **ShellCheck** — shell scripts linted via `shellcheck --format=json`; structured severity/line/message output
- **go vet** — `.go` files linted via `go vet`; stderr parsed for diagnostics
- **hadolint** — `Dockerfile`/`.dockerfile` files linted via `hadolint --format json`
- **clippy** — `.rs` files linted via `cargo clippy` if cargo is in PATH (conditional)

#### version:none Support
- **All 20 local features** now support `"version": "none"` in devcontainer.json to skip installation entirely
- Added `version` option to 7 features that previously lacked it: ccstatusline, notify-hook, shellcheck, mcp-qdrant, mcp-reasoner, splitrail, lsp-servers
- Added skip guard (`if [ "${VERSION}" = "none" ]; then exit 0; fi`) to all 20 install.sh files

#### Advisory Hooks (code-directive plugin)
- **advisory-test-runner.py** `[Stop]` — runs project test suite on Stop, injects pass/fail results as `additionalContext`. Never blocks (always exit 0). Detects pytest, vitest, jest, mocha, go test, cargo test. 60s timeout, truncates to last 30 lines
- **git-state-injector.py** `[SessionStart]` — injects branch, status summary, recent commits, and diff stats as `additionalContext` on every session start. 5s per git command, total output capped at 2000 chars
- **ticket-linker.py** `[UserPromptSubmit]` — auto-fetches GitHub issues/PRs when prompt contains `#123` or full GitHub URLs. Up to 3 refs per prompt, body capped at 1500 chars each
- **commit-reminder.py** `[Stop]` — checks for uncommitted changes (staged/unstaged counts) and injects advisory reminder as `additionalContext`. Checks `stop_hook_active`
- **todo-harvester.py** `[SessionStart]` — greps for TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX across 13 source extensions, injects count + top 10 items. Excludes noise dirs, output capped at 800 chars

#### New Skills (code-directive plugin — 5 new, 21 total)
- **api-design** — REST conventions, error handling patterns, OpenAPI/Swagger guidance
- **ast-grep-patterns** — structural code search patterns across languages
- **dependency-management** — ecosystem-specific audit commands, license compliance
- **documentation-patterns** — docstring formats, API doc templates
- **migration-patterns** — Python and JavaScript framework migration guides

#### Commands & Scripts
- **`cc-tools`** — new shell function listing all installed CodeForge tools with version info
- **`check-setup`** — new health check script (`check-setup.sh`) verifying container setup is working correctly; aliased in shell rc files

#### Workspace
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — workspace-level project instructions (workspace scoping rules)
- **`test-project/`** — minimal test project directory

### Changed

#### NPM Package (setup.js)
- **`--force` is now non-destructive** — selectively syncs files instead of rm+copy. Framework files (scripts, features, plugins) are overwritten; user config files (settings, keybindings, system prompt, file-manifest) are preserved with `.codeforge-new` versions saved for diffing
- **`--reset` flag** — new option for complete fresh install (deletes and re-copies everything)
- **`.codeforge-preserve`** — user-customizable file listing additional paths to preserve during `--force` updates
- **devcontainer.json handling** — user's version backed up as `.bak` during `--force`, then overwritten with package version
- **`.npmignore`** — excludes `.codeforge-new`, `.bak`, and `.codeforge-preserve` artifacts from npm package

#### Setup System
- **setup.sh** — removed `set -e` (individual script failures no longer abort the entire setup); structured pass/fail/skip reporting with elapsed time summary
- **setup-aliases.sh** — backs up `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` before modifying (keeps last 3 backups); cleans up old cc-tools/check-setup definitions; adds `cc-tools` function and `check-setup` alias
- **OVERWRITE_CONFIG deprecated** — replaced by per-file `overwrite` in `config/file-manifest.json`. Legacy env var triggers a deprecation warning

#### Code-Directive Plugin
- **hooks.json** — expanded from 3 to 6 hook events (added Stop, SessionStart, updated UserPromptSubmit with ticket-linker)
- **Agent definitions** — architect gains documentation outputs section + api-design skill link; multiple agents updated with refined instructions
- **skill-suggester.py** — added keyword mappings for 5 new skills (api-design, ast-grep-patterns, dependency-management, documentation-patterns, migration-patterns)
- **specification-writing skill** — expanded with additional templates and patterns
- **code-directive plugin.json** — description updated to "17 custom agents, 16 coding skills, agent redirection, syntax validation, and skill auto-suggestion"

#### Other
- **format-on-stop.py** — rewritten with expanded dispatch: 7 formatters covering 31 file extensions (was 3 formatters, 12 extensions)
- **lint-file.py** — rewritten as multi-language dispatcher: 7 linters across Python, JS/TS/CSS, Shell, Go, Dockerfile, Rust (was Pyright-only for Python)
- **auto-linter hook timeout** — increased from 30s to 60s (each individual linter subprocess still capped at 10s)
- **auto-formatter plugin.json** — description updated to reflect all 7 formatters
- **auto-linter plugin.json** — description updated to reflect all 7 linters
- **marketplace.json** — descriptions updated for auto-formatter, auto-linter, and code-directive plugins
- **devcontainer.json** — 5 new features registered in `overrideFeatureInstallOrder` and `features` object; added install order documentation comments
- **.env.example** — removed `OVERWRITE_CONFIG`, added `SETUP_PROJECTS`, updated descriptions
- **.gitignore** — updated with additional exclusions

### Removed

- **`features/claude-code/`** — entire local feature deleted (Claude Code now installed via `ghcr.io/anthropics/devcontainer-features/claude-code:1`, the official Anthropic feature)
- **`config/settings.json`**, **`config/keybindings.json`**, **`config/main-system-prompt.md`** — moved to `config/defaults/` subdirectory
- **`OVERWRITE_CONFIG` env var** — deprecated in favor of `config/file-manifest.json` per-file overwrite modes

### Documentation

- **New `docs/` directory** with 5 focused guides: configuration-reference, keybindings, optional-features, plugins, troubleshooting
- **CLAUDE.md** — rewritten for new config system (file-manifest.json, config/defaults/), added cc-tools/check-setup commands, added version:none section, updated plugin descriptions
- **README.md** — added new tools (ruff, shfmt, dprint, shellcheck, hadolint, Bun), updated config system docs, added SETUP_PROJECTS and PLUGIN_BLACKLIST env vars, updated ccstatusline description

---

## [v1.7.1] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- **Automatic Git & NPM auth on container start** — new `setup-auth.sh` script reads tokens from `.devcontainer/.secrets` (or environment variables) and configures GitHub CLI, git user identity, and NPM registry auth automatically
- **`.secrets.example` template** — committed template showing required variables (`GH_TOKEN`, `GH_USERNAME`, `GH_EMAIL`, `NPM_TOKEN`)
- **`.env.example` template** — committed template for environment configuration (`.env` itself remains gitignored)
- **`SETUP_AUTH` env var** — controls whether auth setup runs on container start (default: `true`)
- **`AGENT-REDIRECTION.md`** — guide on how the PreToolUse hook system works, how built-in agents are swapped to custom ones, and what else is possible (prompt injection, model overrides, conditional routing, external service chaining)

### Changed

- **README split by audience** — root `README.md` is now the npm/GitHub landing page (install, prerequisites, what's included, quick start); `.devcontainer/README.md` is now the usage guide (auth, tools, config, agents, keybindings, gotchas). No duplicated content between the two
- **Auto-linter moved to Stop hook** — was PostToolUse (ran pyright per-edit, caused agent re-reads); now batch-lints all edited Python files when Claude stops, matching auto-formatter's pattern. Uses its own temp file (`claude-lint-files-{session_id}`) independent of the formatter pipeline
- **`collect-edited-files.py`** — now writes to both `claude-edited-files-*` (formatter) and `claude-lint-files-*` (linter) temp files, keeping the two Stop hook pipelines independent
- **`.devcontainer/.gitignore`** — added `.secrets` explicit ignore and negation patterns (`!.env.example`, `!.secrets.example`, `!.gitignore`) to override root `.*` rule for files that should be tracked
- **`setup.sh` orchestration** — `setup-auth.sh` runs early (after symlink, before config/plugins) so NPM auth is available for plugin installation
- **`PLUGIN_BLACKLIST`** — cleared (was `"workflow-enhancer,planning-reminder"`)

### Removed

- **`workflow-enhancer` plugin** — deleted entirely (was scaffolding only, never active)
- **`planning-reminder` plugin** — deleted entirely (redundant with Claude Code v2.1+ auto plan mode)

---

## [v1.7.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- **ccburn feature** — new devcontainer feature for visual token burn rate tracking with shell aliases and statusline wrapper
- **Session resume widget** — ccstatusline displays copyable `cc --resume {sessionId}` command on line 5
- **Burn rate widget** — ccstatusline line 6 shows live ccburn compact output with pace indicators (session/weekly/sonnet limits)
- **17 custom agent definitions** — code-directive plugin now includes specialized agents: architect, bash-exec, claude-guide, debug-logs, dependency-analyst, doc-writer, explorer, generalist, git-archaeologist, migrator, perf-profiler, refactorer, researcher, security-auditor, spec-writer, statusline-config, test-writer
- **6 new skills** — claude-agent-sdk, git-forensics, performance-profiling, refactoring-patterns, security-checklist, specification-writing
- **Agent redirect hook** — `redirect-builtin-agents.py` (PreToolUse/Task) transparently swaps built-in agent types (Explore→explorer, Plan→architect, etc.) to enhanced custom agents
- **Readonly bash guard** — `guard-readonly-bash.py` blocks write operations for read-only agents
- **Regression test hooks** — `verify-no-regression.py` (PostToolUse for refactorer) and `verify-tests-pass.py` (Stop for test-writer)
- **REVIEW-RUBRIC.md** — quality standards document for agent/skill development
- **Keybindings configuration** — new `config/keybindings.json` with schema support
- **VS Code terminal passthrough** — `Ctrl+P` and `Ctrl+F` pass through to Claude Code via `terminal.integrated.commandsToSkipShell`
- **claude-agent-sdk skill** — new code-directive skill for Claude Agent SDK TypeScript integration
- **OVERWRITE_CONFIG documentation** — documented ephemeral settings behavior
- **Project Manager integration** — `setup-projects.sh` auto-detects projects under `/workspaces/`, watches for changes via inotifywait, maintains `projects.json`
- **Claude config symlink** — `setup-symlink-claude.sh` symlinks `~/.claude` → `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` for third-party tool compatibility
- **Project Manager VS Code extension** — `alefragnani.project-manager` added to devcontainer

### Changed

- **ccstatusline layout** — expanded from 3→6 lines (13→16 widgets), reorganized into logical groups (core metrics, tokens, git, session, totals, burn rate)
- **ccstatusline version** — bumped from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0
- **Plugin declarations centralized** — all 9 marketplace plugins declared in `enabledPlugins` in `config/settings.json`
- **setup-plugins.sh cache sync** — re-added plugin install loop to sync cache from source on every container start; added `.env` fallback so `PLUGIN_BLACKLIST` works on standalone invocation
- **Feature-level config synced** — `features/claude-code/config/settings.json` mirrors main config (model → `claude-opus-4-6`, `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` → `63999`, `cleanupPeriodDays` → `60`, all env vars)
- **8 new env vars** — `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_TOOL_USE_CONCURRENCY`, `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_RETRIES`, `BASH_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH`, `TASK_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH`, `CLAUDE_CODE_PLAN_MODE_INTERVIEW_PHASE`, `CLAUDE_CODE_PLAN_V2_AGENT_COUNT`, `CLAUDE_CODE_PLAN_MODE_REQUIRED`, `CLAUDE_CODE_FORCE_GLOBAL_CACHE`
- **setup-config.sh** — added `chown` for correct ownership; added keybindings.json to copy pipeline
- **setup-aliases.sh** — added idempotency guard
- **TMPDIR consistency** — `setup-update-claude.sh` and `ccstatusline/install.sh` use `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}`
- **installsAfter references** — mcp-qdrant and mcp-reasoner updated from `./features/claude-code` to `ghcr.io/anthropics/devcontainer-features/claude-code:1`
- **code-directive hooks.json** — added PreToolUse/Task hook for agent redirection
- **Auto-linter timeout** — pyright reduced from 55s to 10s
- **Auto-formatter tool paths** — resolved via `which` first
- **Protected-files-guard regex** — tightened `id_rsa` pattern
- **Syntax-validator JSONC regex** — handles URLs containing `://`
- **Skill-suggester keywords** — consolidated claude-agent-sdk phrases; added "compose" to docker
- **redirect-builtin-agents.py fix** — `updatedInput` now preserves all original tool input fields (Claude Code replaces rather than merges)
- **System prompt hardened** — added anti-fabrication rule, failure recovery strategy, and silent-violation guard to `execution_discipline` and `rule_precedence`

### Removed

- **setup-irie-claude.sh** — deleted (personal script, no longer invoked)
- **output-style widget** — removed from ccstatusline (low value)

### Documentation

- **CLAUDE.md** — added keybindings.json, updated plugins list, fixed model name, documented VS Code conflicts, documented OVERWRITE_CONFIG, added agents/skills sections, added new scripts
- **README.md** — fixed max output tokens, added keybindings section, added agents/skills, added project manager
- **features/README.md** — full rewrite listing all features
- **CHANGELOG.md** — squashed v1.6.0 + v1.6.1 into this entry

---

## [v1.5.8] - 2026-02-06

### Changed

- **tmux is now opt-in in VS Code**: Reverted auto-tmux-everywhere approach (forced all terminals into tmux, caused shared-view conflicts and hotkey clashes with Claude Code). Default terminal is plain `bash`. A **"Claude Teams (tmux)"** profile is available from the VS Code terminal dropdown for Agent Teams split-pane sessions. External terminal connectors (WezTerm/iTerm2) are unchanged — they still auto-enter tmux
- **Removed auto-tmux from `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`**: The `exec tmux` block that forced every interactive shell into tmux has been removed from `setup-aliases.sh`

---

## [v1.5.3] - 2026-02-06

### Added

- **Catppuccin Mocha tmux theme**: Replaced barebones tmux config with Catppuccin v2.1.3. Rounded window tabs, Nerd Font icons, transparent status bar, colored pane borders. Installed at build time via shallow git clone (~200KB, ~2s)

### Fixed

- **ccstatusline powerline glyphs**: Powerline separators/caps were empty strings, rendering as underscores. Now uses proper Nerd Font glyphs (U+E0B0, U+E0B4, U+E0B6)
- **Unicode rendering in external terminals**: tmux rendered ALL Unicode as underscores because `docker exec` doesn't propagate locale vars. External terminal scripts now pass `LANG`/`LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8` and use `tmux -u` to force UTF-8 mode. Locale exports also added to `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` as permanent fallback

- **cc/claude aliases**: Converted from shell functions to simple aliases — functions were not reliably invoked across shell contexts (tmux, docker exec, external terminals), causing Claude to launch without config
- **CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR export**: Now exported in `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` directly, so credentials are found in all shells (not just VS Code terminals where `remoteEnv` applies)

---

## [v1.5.0] - 2026-02-06

  - All 10 existing skills migrated from `codedirective-skills`

#### VS Code Extensions
- `GitHub.vscode-github-actions` — GitHub Actions workflow support
